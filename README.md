This repository contains some of my solutions to "try-it" challenges within Python Crash Course (3rd edition) by Eric Matthes.

These programs should be used as references for creating your own solutions. Many challenges are simple with a finite amount of solutions. In these cases, build upon the challenges/solutions with your own additions.
